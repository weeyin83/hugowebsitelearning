With thanks to Writers’ HQ, our supreme writing commanders, glorious leaders and excellent but tiny overlords, who have verily granted us permission to use their splendid and sweary Privacy Policy.

### TL;DR
We are a small community group run in our spare time. We don’t have the time or energy to do anything nefarious with your data. It’s not that we're not evil – we're as corruptible as anyone – we're just too tired to think up a malevolent plot to steal your identity.

### Cookies
Seriously who actually cares? Do you even know what a cookie is or does? Well then. Yes we use cookies because that’s kinda how the Internet works. If you don’t want our delicious home-baked chocolate chip scripts, then you need to block cookies on your browser but don’t come crying to us when nothing does what it’s supposed to.

### Stalky Visitor Tracking
Look, we’re following you, ok? We use Google Analytics and Lite Analytics, primarily to stare at the real time stats because they’re cool but also to see what you like visiting and don't like visiting. 

None of these things store any super personal data about you but probably they nab your IP address, not that we know where to look for it or what to do with it. All we see is that a person or many people have interacted with the website in a particular way. You can mess with us by doing something totally unexpected on the website and skewing our stats. Or you could do something way more fun and useful with your time LIKE WRITING.

### Data Storage
DATA!! It’s all about the data, baby. A tonne of petabytes whirring around the world and what? What’s it all for? WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? What will future historians actually see of us and our slowly collapsing society? So. We store your data on this website. You ready for this?

Let's be honest: we do absolutely nothing unsurprising or radical with your info.

### Social Media
We use social media a lot. If you talk to us on one platform and we become familiar with you, we might find you on Twitter and say hello. You can ask us to be less friendly if you wish and we will of course respect your boundaries.
