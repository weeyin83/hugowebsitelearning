Hi, my name is Gregor Suttie and I live near Glasgow, Scotland.

I am a passionate developer with 20+ years experience, mainly with Microsoft Technologies and background is a .NET developer since the start of .NET. â€“ I was one of the first 50 people in the world to become an MCSD developer back in the day.  In August 2019 I became a Microsoft Azure MVP. 

My main passions are around Azure and DevOps, I went from no knowledge of Azure to an Azure MVP in under 2 years and along the journey passed 9 exams, I learn new skills quickly and I keep on top of a number of technologies and a life learner.
