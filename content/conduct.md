### Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Glasgow Azure User Group community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behaviour. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honoured. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community. 

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free user group/conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. 

Our aim is to foster a community that is open to all and strives to:

* Be friendly and patient
* Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
* Be considerate
* Be respectful: You may not agree with each other all the time but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners.

#### Reporting Process

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via one of these methods:

* Email to conduct@gaug.co.uk
* In person while at an event - please ask to speak to a committee member.

#### Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour
Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately. 

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning. 



We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. 

Attendees or speakers violating these rules will be asked to leave the meeting, and will be refused entrance to future meetings.

### Contact Information

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of organising staff.
